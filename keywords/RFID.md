## Radio Frequency Identification

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to wirelessly identify objects, animals, and humans.[^amserRFID] 
It consists of three major components: an RFID tag (or transponder) that contains digital information, 
a reader (or interrogator) that sends and receives radio waves, and an antenna for signal transmission.[^amserRFID] 
The reader turns on the tag, which then sends data back to the reader, turning radio waves into useable information.[^weinsteinRGID] 
This method enables for the tracking and administration of goods without requiring direct touch or line-of-sight.[^jeulRFID]
